Switch place of Cannons and Rooks, make Cannons on end position to border and Rooks back to position close to knights, easier for castling between king and rooks.
For the consideration of danger in the king's path during castling, cannon's capture mechanism of jump 1 piece over for vertical, horizontal and diagonal won't be considered. 

In the classic 8x8 international chess game, when a knight moved in front of an unmoved allied pawn, the unmoved allied pawn can't move 2 grids to the position in front of the knight. 
Due to the enlargement of board from 8x8, 64 to 10x10, 100, we now allow unmoved pawn to move 2 grids even an allied knight is in front of it. 

For promotion, the pawn can't be cannon.
